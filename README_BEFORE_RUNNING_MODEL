The Bayesian hierarchical occupancy model is designed to estimate blister rust prevalence for whitebark pine throughout time. Unfortunately, when we incorporate data after 2023, the model *itself* does not know what to do with data after 2023!

Somewhat fortunately, we are able to edit the model file to tell it what to do with these new years of data.

This file describes the steps you must take in order to be successful!

1. Duplicate the file "final_model1LMD.STAN"--this is entirely written by Wilson Wright, with updates by LMD to accomodate post-2020 data.
2. Rename your duplicated file "final_model1[YOUR INITIALS].STAN" Be sure that it is a ".STAN" file.
3. Open your copy of the file. [In Notepad or RStudio]
4. Scroll to line 158 (line number is found at the bottom left corner if using Notepad). This line starts with "generated quantities"

5. See lines 159-163, starting with "real prev_t1"? These indicate generated estimates for *prevalence* ["prev"] by *time period* ["t1", "t2", etc]. You will need to add a NEW line for time period 6! [or seven, if we're considering data after 2027!]
6. Copy line 163 (beginning with "real prev_t5") and paste it immediately below itself, in line 164.
7. RENAME "prev_t5" to "prev_t6". (For time period 6!)
8. ALSO RENAME, "theta_year[4]" to "theta_year[5]" (Theta uses the previous time period, hence updating to "5" instead of "6"--IMPORTANT!)
9. AND RENAME at the end of the line "mean_dbh[5]" to "mean_dbh[6]"
10. LASTLY: add a colon (;) at the end of your new line

11. For lines 165-187, starting with "real small_t1"/"real med_t1"/"real large_t1"/"real xlarge_t5", you will repeat the following steps:
12. Copy the line of "real [small/med/large/xlarge]_t5" and paste it right below itself
13. RENAME "[small/med/large/xlarge]_t5" to "t6" (For time period 6!)
14. ALSO RENAME, "theta_year[4]" to "theta_year[5]" (Theta uses the previous time period, hence updating to "5" instead of "6"--IMPORTANT!)
15. LASTLY: add a colon (;) at the end of your new line
16. Repeat these steps for each group of small/med/large/xlarge

17. FINALLY: Ensure the file ends with a fancy bracket ("}")

Save and exit this file.

Parting note: When you are in "/scripts/bayesian_blisterrust.R", edit the code line where you "import"/specify the model to swap my initials (LMD) in the filename with your initials, so the filename matches your updated version of the model "final_model1[YOUR INITIALS].STAN"
