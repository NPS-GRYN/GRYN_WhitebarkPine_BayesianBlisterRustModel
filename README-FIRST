This repo is intended to more-so store the actual code scripts and does not contain the full suite of files necessary to run a new iteration of the model or to reproduce prior work. Please see the R project "GRYN Whitebark Bayesian Blister Rust" or its zipfile for complete information (on the NPS GRYN server/SquirrelShare) or contact Lydia Druin (lydiadruin@outlook.com, code author), Erin Shanahan (erin_shanahan@nps.gov, WBP biologist), or Rob Daley (rob_daley@nps.gov, data manager).
